Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect/Procedural

Unityâ€™s Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect (from here on out, just DMII) is 
an absolute necessity for making danmaku games in Unity. At the same time, 
nobody seems to know what it is or how it works. As one of the confused, 
I'm somewhat hesitant to publish this, but hopefully it can help future me 
as well as other Unity randos be a little less lost when working with this odd API.
